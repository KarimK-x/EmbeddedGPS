# EmbeddedGPS

An embedded system project for interfacing with a GPS module to acquire and process real-time location data.

## üìå Overview

EmbeddedGPS is a C-based application designed for embedded systems. It communicates with a GPS module to obtain NMEA sentences, parse GPS coordinates, and calculate distances between geographic locations. This project is ideal for students, hobbyists, or professionals working on navigation, tracking, or IoT systems.

## üß© Features

- Real-time GPS data acquisition
- NMEA sentence parsing
- Distance calculation between coordinates
- Modular code structure
- Hardware-agnostic C implementation (portable to most microcontrollers)

## üìÅ Project Structure


- `INCLUDE/`: Header files for GPS and UART modules
- `SRC/`: Implementation files
- `FullyWorkingProjectMay12.rar`: Complete working project archive
